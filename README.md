Smart Expense and Budget Manager

Author: Saurabh Chaudhari

Day 1 Smart Expense Management System

On Day 1, I built the foundation of the Smart Expense and Budget Manager using only core Python.
The main focus was to design a structured expense tracking system and understand how real world data can be stored and managed.

Project Understanding

This project works as a simple console based expense tracker where:
User can add daily expenses
Each expense is stored in structured format
Data is managed using list of dictionaries
Categories are controlled using tuple
Total spending is calculated dynamically
The goal is to simulate how financial data can be collected and processed before doing analytics.

What I Implemented

Fixed categories using tuple
Expense storage using list of dictionaries
add_expense function for taking structured user input
Category validation logic
view_expenses function to display records properly
calculate_total function using map and reduce
Clean function based code structure

Key Concepts Practiced

Data handling using list and dictionary
Input validation using condition statements
String methods like strip and lower
Loop for structured data display
Functional programming approach using map and reduce

Learning Outcomes

Understood how real world data can be structured
Improved logical thinking and program flow design
Learned how to break a program into reusable functions
Gained confidence in handling structured data
Strengthened foundation for data analytics projects

Day 2 Budget Validation and Category Level Analytics

On Day 2, I enhanced the project by adding budget monitoring and basic analytical features. The main focus was to move from only storing data to analyzing the stored expense data.

What I Implemented

Implemented budget checking logic to compare total expense with predefined budget
Added category wise expense summary using dictionary aggregation
Filtered high value expenses using lambda and filter
Extracted unique categories using set

Key Concepts Practiced

Conditional statements for budget validation
Dictionary based aggregation logic
Functional programming using lambda and filter
Set data structure for unique value extraction

Learning Outcomes

Understood how to analyze expense data category wise
Learned how to apply business logic like budget tracking
Improved analytical thinking using real expense scenarios
Strengthened problem solving skills for data analytics role

Next step will focus on adding date based analysis and generating a final summary report.
